This concept was born when founder, Cyndi Sladics, was looking for a solution for her dental patients. She knew straws help protect our teeth from the acids in drinks that cause teeth sensitivity, staining and erosion. She also knew the plastic straws leached chemicals mimicking hormones that disrupt our system, in addition to living in landfills for a thousand years. With a passion to educate the public on the effects of plastic pollution, and a commitment to work with organizations to minimize them - they began. They set out a mission to reduce the 500 million plastic straws disposed daily in USA!"

The asset financing allows Juhudi Kilimo to work in the poorest rural communities in Kenya where little business activity or collateral exists. The micro-asset loans dramatically improve both income and food security for the farmers. For example, a farmer can take a loan for a high-yield dairy cow which will generate enough milk in 12 months to pay for the cow, the interest on the loan, the training, and still leave the farmer with extra income and milk to benefit a family. Once the loan has been repaid the farmer will own the asset and after several loans they can build an entire asset base which can double and triple the farmer\u2019s income."

At the very least the book is recycled.   Chile is a country that has a relatively high level of literacy, upwards of over 97% of the population can read, but less than half of Chileans have read a book in the last year.  The primary reason that people give for not reading is the high cost of books and the lack of access to books.   By donating books directly, as well as donating a percentage of the revenue of each sale they make a direct impact.  Yet even more interesting is that their model allows them to offer books they sell at much lower costs than previously available in the market, indirectly influencing market prices towards greater accessibility."
